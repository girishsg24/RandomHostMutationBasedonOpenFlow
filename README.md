RandomHostMutationBasedonOpenFlow
=================================

Static configurations, especially IP addresses, give the adversaries great opportunities to discover network targets and then launch attacks. Frequently changing hostsâ€™ IP addresses to hide their real ones is a novel method to solve this problem. A recent paper OpenFlow Random Host Mutation: Transparent Moving Target Defense using Software Defined Networking specified this new proactive moving target defense. In this assignment, I implement a simple model to replicate the result of this paper based on Mininet network emulation environment, OpenFlow architecture and protocol, and SDN technique. This report includes three major parts: the design of the controller, the implementation of my method, and discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of my approach.
